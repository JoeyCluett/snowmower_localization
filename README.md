This repository contains an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) that fuses wheel encoder, IMU, visual odometry, and DecaWave beacon measurements, along with a model of differential drive vehicle kinematics, into an estimation of the robots location.

## To Do ##
* Create an EKF class.

* Code up the equations for the system model and verify.

* Code up the equations for the measurement models and verify.
